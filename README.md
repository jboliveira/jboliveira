### 🤠 &nbsp;About Me

I very much enjoy reading/viewing things about technology and gastronomy. After traveling to many countries, I have learned about different cultures and discovered interesting places. I enjoy walking through forests and around the lakes with my wife and dog. Blizzard games are another interest of mine, so sometimes I can be found playing on my computer. I like cheese and wine. I drink my tea without sugar. Though coffee is my preferred beverage.
